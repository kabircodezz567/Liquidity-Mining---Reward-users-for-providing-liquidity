## Project Title
**SimpleLiquidityMining** - A Decentralized Liquidity Incentive Protocol

## Project Description

SimpleLiquidityMining is a streamlined DeFi protocol that incentivizes users to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges by offering reward tokens. Users can stake their LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens and earn passive rewards over time based on their contribution to the liquidity pool.

The protocol operates on a simple time-based reward mechanism where users earn reward tokens proportionally to their staked amount and the duration of their participation. This creates a sustainable ecosystem that encourages long-term liquidity provision while rewarding early adopters and committed participants.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize DeFi liquidity mining by creating an accessible, transparent, and efficient protocol that:

- **Simplifies** the liquidity mining experience for both novice and experienced DeFi users
- **Incentivizes** sustainable liquidity provision across decentralized exchanges
- **Promotes** fair reward distribution based on contribution and commitment
- **Builds** a foundation for more advanced DeFi financial products
- **Fosters** community-driven governance and protocol evolution

We aim to become a cornerstone protocol that bridges traditional finance concepts with decentralized finance innovation, making yield farming accessible to everyone.

## Key Features

### üîê **Secure Staking Mechanism**
- Stake LP tokens safely with built-in security checks
- Transparent on-chain tracking of all staked assets
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities

### üí∞ **Time-Based Rewards**
- Earn rewards proportional to staked amount and time
- Configurable reward rates (100 tokens per hour per staked token by default)
- Real-time reward calculation and tracking

### üìä **Simple Interface**
- Only 5 core functions for easy integration
- Clear event emissions for frontend integration
- Minimal gas costs for user interactions

### üéØ **Flexible Withdrawal**
- Withdraw staked LP tokens at any time
- Partial withdrawal support
- Separate reward claiming mechanism

### ‚ö° **Real-time Reward Tracking**

- Accurate reward calculations based on blockchain timestamps
- Transparent reward distribution algorithm

## Smart Contract Functions

| Function | Description | Access |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `stakeLPTokens(uint256)` | Stake LP tokens to earn rewards | Public |
| `withdrawLPTokens(uint256)` | Withdraw staked LP tokens | Public |
| `claimRewards()` | Claim accumulated reward tokens | Public |
| `getPendingRewards(address)` | View pending rewards (read-only) | Public |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Hardhat or Truffle
- MetaMask wallet
- LP tokens from supported DEXs

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat deploy --network mainnet
```

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Stake 100 LP tokens
await liquidityMining.stakeLPTokens(ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));

// Check pending rewards
const rewards = await liquidityMining.getPendingRewards(userAddress);

// Claim rewards
await liquidityMining.claimRewards();
```
